\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
This project could not have been completed without the guidance of my project 
supervisor, \supervisorName{}. He always made himself available to assist me 
with the understanding of many new and unknown concepts. His expertise in the 
field was a great asset and greatly contributed to my own understanding of the 
ideas explored in this thesis. His support and guidance was invaluable, and were
instrumental to the success of my project. 

Much of the works completed during this project could not have been performed 
without the prior research of \getPerson{Chawla} and \getPerson{Khoa}. Both were
generous enough to lend their own support and expertise in order to gain an 
understanding of the implemented random projection algorithms.

Additionally, I must thank \getPerson{Frechtling} for his assistance and advice 
throughout the project. He assisted me with Xilnix tools such as ``AutoESL'', 
and also offered me valuable advice regarding my future professional career.

% Abstract

\begin{abstract}
The prediction of the stock market has become an issue of great interest in the
areas of finance, mathematics and engineering; due mainly to the great potential
financial gain. Researchers have devised various algorithms and differing 
approaches to the problem of stock market analysis, with varying degrees of 
success.

A major outstanding issue for stock market analysis is the effective and 
efficient detection of local anomalies in the input data sets, which are 
inherently highly multidimensional. Many na\"{\i}ve algorithms are highly 
inefficient and others fail to adequately detect local anomalies altogether. It
had become a time-vs-correctness trade-off in which no acceptable compromise
could be reached.

However, researchers are starting to explore the relatively new concept of 
applying \doubleQuote{random projections} to the highly multidimensional data 
sets. Research has suggested that by applying these random projections, they are
able to significantly reduce the dimensionality (and consequently the
computational complexity) of the data sets, whilst sufficiently retaining the 
inherent properties of that data set --- at least so much so as anomaly
detection is concerned.

Anomaly detection is important because it allows otherwise-accurate machine 
learning algorithms such as neural networks to more accurately model and predict
the stock exchange data by ignoring anomalous data, which likely doesn't effect 
the state of the model to any significant degree.

\getPerson{Chawla} from the \universityName{} has in recent years conducted and 
supervised new and exciting research oriented around random projections. In 
particular, \getPerson{Khoa}, under the supervision of \getPerson{Chawla} 
evaluated the use of traditional distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance 
and Mahalanobis distance, in the application of local anomaly detection. 
\getPerson{Khoa} proposed the use of the \singleQuote{commute time} metric, 
derived from random walks on graphs, in anomaly detection.
