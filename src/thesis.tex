\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
This project could not be completed without the guidance of my project 
supervisor, \supervisorName{}. He always made himself available to assist me 
with the understanding with many new and unknown concepts. His expertise in the 
field was a great asset and greatly contributed to my own understanding of the 
ideas explored in this thesis. His support and guidance was invaluable, and were
instrumental to the success of my project. 

Additionally, much of the works completed during this project could not have 
been performed without the prior research of \contributorOne{} and 
\contributorTwo{}. Both were generous enough to lend their own support and 
expertise in order to gain an understanding of the implemented random projection
algorithms.

% Abstract

\begin{abstract}
The prediction of the stock market has become an issue of great interest in the
fields of finance, mathematics and engineering; due mainly to its great 
potential financial gain. Many researchers have devised various algorithms and
differing approaches to the problem of stock market analysis, with varying 
degrees of success.

A major outstanding issue for stock market analysis is the effective and 
efficient detection of local anomalies in the input data sets, which are 
inherently highly multidimensional. Many na\"{\i}ve algorithms are highly 
inefficient and others fail to adequately detect the local anomalies altogether.
It had become a time-vs-correctness trade-off in which no accepted compromise
could be reached.

However, researchers are starting to explore the relatively new concept of 
applying ``random projections'' to the highly multidimensional data sets. 
Researchers have proven that by applying these random projections, they are
able to significantly reduce the dimensionality of the data sets, whilst 
sufficiently retaining the inherent properties of that data set --- at least so
much as anomaly detection is concerned.

Anomaly detection is important because it allows otherwise-accurate machine 
learning algorithms such as neural networks to more accurately model and 
predict the stock exchange data by ignoring anomaly data, which likely doesn't 
effect the state of the model to any significant degree.

\emph{Professor Sanjay Chawla} from the ``University of Sydney'' has in recent 
years conducted and supervised new and exciting research oriented around random 
projections. In particular, \emph{Nguyen Lu Dang Khoa}, under the supervision of
\emph{Professor Chawla} evaluated the use of traditional distance metrics, such
as Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance, in the application of local 
anomaly detection. Khoa proposed the use of the `commute time' metric, derived 
from random walks on graphs, in anomaly detection.
