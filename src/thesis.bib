		researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many 
		anomaly	detection techniques have been specifically developed for 
		certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey 
		tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research
		on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different
		categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique.
		For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by 
		the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior.
		When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions
		can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique
		in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection
		technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that 
		category are variants of the basic technique. This template	provides an 
		easier and succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each 
		category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and 
		disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a 
		discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is
		an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey
		will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which
		research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in  
		one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to  
		begin with.},

		(the expected length of a random walk from $s$ to $t$ and back) is
		precisely characterized by the effective resistance $R_{st}$ between $s$
		and $t$: commute time = $2mR_{st}$. Additionally, the cover time (the
		expected length of a random walk visiting all vertices) is characterized
		by the maximum resistance $R$ in the graph to within a factor of $\log
		n$: $mR ≤ cover time ≤ O (mR \log n)$. For many graphs, the bounds on
		cover time obtained in this manner are better than those obtained from 
		previous techniques such as the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. In
		particular, using this approach, we improve known bounds on cover times
		for various classes of graphs, including high-degree graphs, expanders, 
		and multi-dimensional meshes. Moreover, resistance seems to provide an

		(the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of
		the graph, etc) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, 
		having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths 
		connecting those elements increases and when the ``length'' of paths 
		decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time
		is a Euclidean distance and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian 
		matrix is a kernel (its elements are inner products closely related to 
		commute times). A procedure for computing the subspace projection of the
		node vectors of the graph that preserves as much variance as possible in
		terms of the commute-time distance --- a principal component analysis 
		(PCA) of the graph --- is also introduced. This graph PCA provides a 
		nice interpretation to the ``Fiedler vector'', widely used for graph 
		partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative-recommendation 
		task where suggestions are made about which movies people should watch 
		based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the 
		MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities perform 
		well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into
		the so-called ``statistical relational learning'' framework, could also 
		be used to compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, 
		it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks

		detection can be done efficiently for large datasets, and for 
		k-dimensional datasets with large values of $k$ (e.g., $k \ge 5$); and 
		(ii), outlier detection is a meaningful and important knowledge

		complexity of $O(k \: N^2)$, $k$ being the dimensionality and $N$ being 
		the number of objects in the dataset. These algorithms readily support 
		datasets with many more than two attributes. Second, we present an 
		optimized cell-based algorithm that has a complexity that is linear with
		respect to $N$, but exponential with respect to $k$. We provide 
		experimental results indicating that this algorithm significantly 
		outperforms the two	simple algorithms for $k \leq 4$. Third, for 
		datasets that are mainly disk-resident, we present another version of 
		the cell-based algorithm that guarantees at most three passes over a 
		dataset. Again, experimental results show that this algorithm is by far 
		the best for $k \leq 4$. Finally, we discuss our work on three real-life
		applications, including one on spatio-temporal data (e.g., a video

		Stone Ridge RDX-11 hardware platform with a combination of HDL and 
		Impulse C, accepts and processes ITCH packet sat line speed with 
		extremely low latency. Our implementation parses sixteen different stock
		symbols in the feed and generates an outbound packet on the NASDAQ one 
		second heartbeat. The unit was tested with an artificial feed that could
		be adjusted in speed to simulate market surges. The system demonstrated 
		a turnaround latency of $2.7\mu{}s$ with very little variation for all 
		tested feed rates. The CPU equivalent demonstrated $38 \pm 22 \mu{}s$ 
		(1x rate) with a long tail illustrating the variability inherent to
		processing by the host O/S. The FPGA solution demonstrated ultra-low,
		deterministic latency and was able to continue processing data at the

	journaltitle = {Knowledge and Information Systems},
	year = {2011},
	month = {06},
	abstract = {Outlier or anomaly detection is a fundamental data mining task 
		with the aim to identify data points, events, transactions which deviate
		from the norm. The identification of outliers in data can provide 
		insights about the underlying data generating process. In general, 
		outliers can be of two kinds: global and local. Global outliers are
		distinct with respect to the whole data set, while local outliers are
		distinct with respect to data points in their local neighbourhood. While
		several approaches have been proposed to scale up the process of global
		outlier discovery in large databases, this has not been the case for 
		local outliers. We tackle this problem by optimising the use of local 
		outlier factor (LOF) for large and high-dimensional	data. We propose 
		projection-indexed nearest-neighbours (PINN), a novel technique that 
		exploits extended nearest-neighbour sets in a reduced-dimensional space 
		to create an accurate approximation for k-nearest-neighbour distances, 
		which is used as the core density measurement within LOF. The reduced 
		dimensionality allows for efficient sub-quadratic indexing in the number
		of items in the data set, where previously only quadratic performance 
		was possible. A detailed theoretical analysis of random projection (RP) 
		and PINN shows that we are able to preserve the density of the intrinsic
		manifold of the data set after projection. Experimental results show 
		that PINN outperforms the standard projection methods RP and PCA when 
		measuring LOF for many high-dimensional real-world data sets of up to 
		300,000 elements and 102,600 dimensions. A further investigation into 
		the use of high-dimensionality-specific indexing such as spatial 
		approximate sample hierarchy (SASH) shows that our novel technique holds
		benefits over even these types of highly efficient indexing. We cement 
		the practical applications of our novel technique with insights into 
		what it means to find local outliers in real data including image and 
		text data, and include potential applications for this knowledge.},

		evolution of input features. Then, another GA is used for parameters

		Finally, the evolving LSSVM learning paradigm with best feature subset,

		movement direction in terms of historical data series. For illustration 
		and evaluation purposes, three important stock indices, S&P 500 Index,
		Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) Index, and New York Stock Exchange
		(NYSE) Index, are used as testing targets. Experimental results obtained
		reveal that the proposed evolving LSSVM can produce some forecasting
		models that are easier to be interpreted by using a small number of
		predictive features and are more efficient than other parameter 
		optimization methods. Furthermore, the produced forecasting model can
		significantly outperform other forecasting models listed in this paper
