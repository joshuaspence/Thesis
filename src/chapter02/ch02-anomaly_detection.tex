Anomaly detection is the process of detecting patterns in a given data set that 
do not conform to an ``expected'' behavior \cite{Chandola:2007}, although it is
often difficult to accurate predict expected patterns and distributions for data
sets. The terms `anomaly' and `outlier' are used synonymously, both within this 
thesis and more generally in the field of statistics.

According to \citeauthor{Hawkins:1980} \cite{Hawkins:1980}:
\begin{quote}
An outlier is an observation which deviates so much from the other observations 
as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism.
\end{quote}

Anomaly and outlier detection are challenging areas that have gained much 
interest within the field of computer science. The importance of anomaly 
detection is due to the fact that anomalies in data translate to significant 
(and often critical) actionable information in a wide variety of application 
domains \cite{Chandola:2007}. Over time, many techniques for anomaly 
detection have been developed for specific application domains, as well as more 
generic techniques \cite{Chandola:2007}.

% WHAT ARE ANOMALIES?
\subsection{What are anomalies?}
\label{sec:whatAreAnomalies}
Anomalies are patterns in data that do not conform to a well defined notion of
normal behavior. \hyperref[fig:2d-anomalies]{Figure~\ref{fig:2d-anomalies}} 
illustrates anomalies in a simple 2-dimensional data set. The data has two 
normal regions, $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$, since most observations lie in these two 
regions. Points that are sufficiently far away from the regions, such as points 
$o_{1}$ and $o_{2}$, and points in region $O_{3}$, are considered to be 
anomalies.

% CHALLENGES
\subsection{Challenges}
\label{sec:anomalyDetectionChallenges}
A straightforward anomaly detection approach, is to define a region representing
`normal' behaviour and declare any observation in the data which does not belong
to this normal region as an anomaly. But several factors make this apparently 
simple approach very challenging:

\begin{itemize}
\item Defining a normal region which encompasses every possible normal behaviour 
is very difficult. In addition, the boundary between normal and anomalous 
behaviour is often not precise. Thus an anomalous observation which lies close
to the boundary can actually be normal, and vice-versa.
\item When anomalies are the result of malicious actions, the malicious 
adversaries often adapt themselves to make the anomalous observations appear 
like normal, thereby making the task of defining normal behavior more difficult.
\item In many domains normal behavior keeps evolving and a current notion of
normal behavior might not be sufficiently representative in the future.
\item The exact notion of an anomaly is different for different application 
domains. For example, in the medical domain a small deviation from normal (for
example, fluctuations in body temperature) might be an anomaly, while similar 
deviation in the stock market domain (for example, fluctuations in the value of 
a stock) might be considered as normal. Thus applying a technique developed in 
one domain to another is not straightforward.
\item Availability of labeled data for training/validation of models used by 
anomaly detection techniques is usually a major issue.
\item Often the data contains noise which tends to be similar to the actual 
anomalies and hence is difficult to distinguish and remove.
\end{itemize}

Due to the above challenges, the anomaly detection problem, in its most general
form, is not easy to solve. In fact, most of the existing anomaly detection 
techniques solve a specific formulation of the problem. The formulation is 
induced by various factors such as nature of the data, availability of labeled 
data, type of anomalies to be detected, etc. Often, these factors are determined
by the application domain in which the anomalies need to be detected. 
Researchers have adopted concepts from diverse disciplines such as statistics, 
machine learning, data mining, information theory, spectral theory, and have 
applied them to specific problem formulations.

Researchers have adopted concepts from diverse disciplines such as statistics, 
data mining, statistics, information theory and spectral theory in order to gain
an increased understanding of anomalies \cite{Chandola:2007}.

% SIMILAR PROBLEMS
\subsection{Similar problems}
\label{sec:similarProblems}
Anomaly detection is an intentionally broad specifier for a class of 
more-specific statisctical challenges. For example, whilst being distinct from, 
anomaly detection is a similar problem (in terms of complexity and approach) to 
that of \emph{noise removal} and \emph{noise accomodation}, both of which are 
aimed at removing the effects of unwanted \emph{noise} in the data. Noise can be
defined as any data which is not of specific interest to the analyst, but in its
presence hinders data analysis techniques \cite{Chandola:2007}. It is often 
critical to data analysis to remove or mitigate the effects that noise has to 
the properties of the host data set.

In contrast, the problem of \emph{novelty detection} can often be impeded by 
techniques that attempt to remove anomalous data from a data set. \emph{Novelty 
detection} is process of discovering emerging patterns in a data set, to provide
an indication of the future state of a system. The distinction between novel
pattern and anomalies is that novel patterns are incorporated into the data 
model after detection \cite{Chandola:2007}.

% CLASSIFICATION
\subsection{Classification}
\label{sec:anomalyClassification}
In general, two different kinds of outliers exist: global outliers and local 
outliers. Global outliers are distinct with respect to the whole data set, while
local outliers are distinct with respect to data points in their local 
neighbourhood \cite{Vries:2011}. The task of global outlier detection has 
undergone much research \citeneeded{}, but this has not been the case for local 
outlier detection. In the paper \citetitle{Vries:2011}, \citeauthor{Vries:2011} 
optimise the use of local outlier factor (LOF) for large and high-dimensional 
data and propose projection-indexed nearest-neighbours (PINN) --- a novel 
technique that exploits extended nearest-neighbour sets in a reduced-dimensional
space --- to create an accurate approximation for k-nearest-neighbour distances, 
which is used as the core density measurement within LOF \cite{Vries:2011}.

\subsection{Types of anomalies}
\label{sec:typesOfAnomalies}
Anomalies can be classified into three categories \cite{Chandola:2007}:

\begin{description}
\item[Point anomaly] If an individual data instance can be considered as 
anomalous with respect to the rest of data, then the instance is termed as a 
point anomaly. This is the simplest type of anomaly. Referring to 
\hyperref[fig:2d-anomalies]{Figure~\ref{fig:2d-anomalies}}, points $o_{1}$ and 
$o_{2}$, as well as all points in region $O_{3}$ lie outside the boundary of the
normal regions, and are hence point anomalies.

\item[Contextual anomalies] If a data instance is anomalous in a certain 
context, but not otherwise, then it is termed a contextual anomaly. The notion 
of a context is induced by the structure in the data set and has to be specified
as part of the problem formulation.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{contextual-anomalies}
\caption[Contextual anomaly $t_{2}$ in a temperature time series.]{Contextual 
anomaly $t_{2}$ in a temperature time series. Note that the temperature at time 
$t_{1}$ is same as that at time $t_{2}$ but occurs in a different context and 
hence is not considered as an anomaly \cite{Chandola:2007}.}
\label{fig:contextual-anomalies}
\end{figure}

Contextual anomalies have been most commonly explored in time-series data and 
spatial data. \hyperref[fig:contextual-anomalies]
{Figure~\ref{fig:contextual-anomalies}} shows one such example for a temperature
time series which shows the monthly temperature of an area over last few years. 
A temperature of $35\degree F$ might be normal during the winter (at time 
$t_{1}$) at that place, but the same value during summer (at time $t_{2}$) would
be an anomaly.

\item[Collective anomalies] If a collection of related data instances is 
anomalous with respect to the entire data set, it is termed as a collective 
anomaly. The individual data instances in a collective anomaly may not be 
anomalies by themselves, but their occurrence together as a collection is 
anomalous. \hyperref[fig:collective-anomalies]
{Figure~\ref{fig:collective-anomalies}} illustrates an example which shows a 
human electrocardiogram output. The highlighted region denotes an anomaly 
because the same low value exists for an abnormally long time. Note that that 
low value by itself is not an anomaly.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{collective-anomalies}
\caption[Collective anomaly corresponding to an \emph{Atrial Premature 
Contraction} in an human electrocardiogram output.]{Collective anomaly 
corresponding to an \emph{Atrial Premature Contraction} in an human 
electrocardiogram output \cite{Goldberger:2000}.}

% APPROACHES
\subsection{Approaches}

\begin{description}
\item[Classical] A point is declared to be an outlier if its distance from the 
mean is sufficiently large.
\item[Principal Component Analysis] An outlier is usually declared if the point 
is sufficiently far away from the subspace spanned by the eigenvectors 
corresponding to the highest eigenvalues.
\item[Distance based] A point can be declared to be an outlier if its distance 
to its kth nearest-neighbour is sufficiently large.
\item[Statistical based] Statistical methods are often model-based and assume 
that the data should follow some distribution. With knowledge of the 
distribution, data point are evaluated by their fitness to the assumed 
distribution. If the probability of a data instance is less than a certain 
threshold, then that data point is considered an anomaly.
\end{description}

Although distance is an effective non-parametric approach to detecting outliers,
the drawback is the amount of computation time required. Straightforward 
algorithms, such as those based on nested loops, typically require $O(N^{2})$
distance computations. This quadratic scaling means that it will be very 
difficult to mine outliers as we tackle increasingly larger data sets. This is a 
major problem for many real databases where there are often millions of records 
\cite{Bay:2003}.

\subsubsection{Distance based}
In this approach, one looks at the local neighborhood of points for an example 
typically defined by the $k$ nearest examples (also known as neighbours). If the
neighbouring points are relatively close, then the example is considered normal;
if the neighbouring points are far away, then the example is considered unusual.
The advantages of distance-based outliers are that no explicit distribution 
needs to be defined to determine unusualness, and that it can be applied to any 
feature space for which we can define a distance measure \cite{Bay:2003}.

Researchers have tried a variety of approaches to find these outliers 
efficiently. The simplest are those using nested loops \cite{Bay:2003}. In the 
basic version one compares each example with every other example to determine 
its $k$ nearest neighbors. Given the neighbors for each example in the data set,
simply select the top $n$ candidates according to the outlier definition. This 
approach has quadratic complexity as we must make all pairwise distance 
computations between examples.

Another method for finding outliers is to use a spatial indexing structure such 
as a KD-tree, R-tree, or X-tree to find the nearest neighbors of each candidate 
point. One queries the index structure for the closest $k$ points to each 
example, and as before one simply selects the top candidates according to the 
outlier definition. For low-dimensional data sets this approach can work 
extremely well and potentially scales as $O(N \log N)$ if the index tree can
find an example's nearest neighbors in $\log N$ time. However, index structures 
break down as the dimensionality increases \cite{Bay:2003}.

\subsubsection{Statistical based}
A common distribution considered when modelling data is the `Normal' 
distribution. Using this model, the probability that a data instance lies within
$k$ standard deviations $\sigma$ from the mean $\mu$ is the area between 
$\mu - k\sigma$ and $\mu + k\sigma$.

% LOCAL OUTLIER FACTOR
\subsection{Local Outlier Factor}
\label{sec:localOutlierFactor}
`Local Outlier Factor' is a formula that captures the degree to which a data 
point is an outlier with respect to its local neighbourhood. In this context,
`local' means that the determination of the data points does not depend on 
knowledge of the global distribution of the data set.
