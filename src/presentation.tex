% Warn about commands, classes and packages that are outdated and superseded.
% Orthodox checks for pitfalls that are not technically incorrect.
%\usepackage[l2tabu,orthodox,abort]{nag}

% For font and input encoding.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
%\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Pretty much all of the ams maths packages.
\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm,amssymb,amsfonts}

% Allows inclusion of graphics easily and "configurably".
\usepackage{graphicx}

% Typesets URLs sensibly --- with a TrueType font, hyperlinked in PDFs, and not
% breaking across lines.
\usepackage{url}

% Provides good access to colours.
\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{xcolor}

% Count the number of used registers (counter, dimen, skip, muskip, box, token,
% input, output, math families, languages, insertions). Also time the amount of
% time required for LaTeX compilation.
\usepackage[timer,left]{regstats}

% For greater control over customising lists.
\usepackage{enumitem}

% The listings package is a source code printer for LaTeX. You can typeset stand
% alone files as well as listings with an environment similar to verbatim as
% well as you can print code snippets using a command similar to \verb.
\usepackage{listings}

% This package implements high-level interface commands for class file writers
% which allows the separation of formatting commands (typically instances of
% so-called `templates') and their arguments from the signature of
% document-level commands.
\usepackage{xparse}

% This package allows verbatim text to be typeset in bold.
\usepackage{alltt}
\renewcommand{\ttdefault}{txtt}

% This style option improves the interface for defining floating objects such
% as figures and tables in LaTeX. It adds the notion of a `float style' that
% governs appearance of floats. New kinds of floats may be defined using a
% \newfloat command analogous to \newtheorem. This style option also
% incorporates the functionality of David Carlisle's style option here, giving
% floating environments a [H] option which means `PUT IT HERE' (as opposed to
% the standard [h] option which means `You may put it here if you like').
\usepackage{float}

% This is the style file for the gnuplot PGF/TikZ terminal. It is associated
% with the 'gnuplot.lua' script.
\usepackage{gnuplot-lua-tikz}

% The caption package provides many ways to customise the captions in floating
% environments such figure and table.
\usepackage{caption}

% This package supports typesetting of sub-captions (by using the the
% sub-caption feature of the caption package).
\usepackage{subcaption}

% A new environment, tabularx, is defined, which takes the same arguments as
% tabular*, but modifies the widths of certain columns, rather than the inter
% column space, to set a table with the requested total width. The columns that
% may stretch are marked with the new token X in the preamble argument.
% NOTE: Requires the array package
\usepackage{array}
\usepackage{tabularx}

% This package reimplements the LATEX verbatim and verbatim* environments. In
% addition it provides a comment environment that skips any commands or text
% between \begin{comment} and the next \end{comment}. It also defines the
% command verbatim to input a whole file verbatim.
\usepackage{verbatim}

\usepackage[noline,ruled]{algorithm2e}
\usepackage{pgfplots}
\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{positioning,shapes,shadows,arrows}

% My custom packages.
