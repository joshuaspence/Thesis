\section{Algorithm Profiling}
\label{sec:algorithmProfiling}
In order to choose which step of the algorithm would be best suited for 
implementation on FPGA hardware, it is necessary to first profile the execution 
of the algorithm using various test cases. This task was performed using MATLAB,
using code supplied by Khoa that was used as a part of the thesis. Using 
MATLAB's \verb+profile+ command, I was able to analyse the algorithm and make an
assessment of the running time of the algorithm.
