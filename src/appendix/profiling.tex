This appendix shows the results obtained from profiling code execution at
various stages throughout the project.

\section{MATLAB}
\label{profiling:matlab}
This section details the results of profiling the original (\software{MATLAB})
code across numerous data sets. The following plots compare the self execution
time of functions composing the \command{commute_distance_anomaly} algorithm.

The data for the plots was obtained using the \software{MATLAB}
\command{profile} command. Descriptions of the data sets can be found in
\autoref{dataSets}.

Please note that, in the following plots, any functions with a self time less
than 3\% of the total execution time have been aggregated and are represented in
the plots by ``Other''.

\section{C}
\label{profiling:c}
This section details the results of profiling the intial C implementation of the
\command{TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block} function across numerous data sets. The
following plots compare the self execution time of subfunctions that are called
during the execution of the \command{TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block} function.

The data for the plots was obtained using \software{The GNU Profiler}
(\command{gprof}). Descriptions of the data sets can be found in
\autoref{dataSets}.

Please note that, in the following plots, any functions with a self time less
than 3\% of the total execution time have been aggregated and are represented in
the plots by ``Other''.

\section{Block size}
\label{profiling:blockSize}
This section details the results of profiling the initial C implementation of
the \command{TopN_Outlier_Pruning_Block} function across numerous data sets, and
with a varying block size. In addition, the execution time of the algorithm was
compared with a modified implementation which does not use blocking in any way.

The data for the plots was obtained using the \software{MATLAB}
\command{profile} command. Descriptions of the data sets can be found in
\autoref{dataSets}.
